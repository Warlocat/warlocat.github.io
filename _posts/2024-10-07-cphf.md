The coupled-perturbed Hartree-Fock (CPHF) equations are used to solve the response of molecular orbitals to each external perturbation (the $$U^x$$ matrices below).
Before working on the derivations, it is worth noting that the CPHF equations are not explicitly solved for first-order energy derivatives (i.e., gradients) in quantum chemistry. 
Please see the comments at the end of this note for details.
            
The Hartree-Fock (or density functional theory) eigenvalue-equations remain true in the presence of external perturbations $$x$$, i.e.,

$$
    F^{AO}(x)C(x)=S^{AO}(x)C(x)E(x)
$$

The unperturbed coefficients $$C(0)$$ represent the unperturbed molecular orbitals $$\phi_p(0)=\sum_\mu C_{\mu p}(0)f_\mu$$, where $$f_\mu$$ are the atomic orbitals.
With perturbation, the molecular orbitals can be expanded in the basis of unperturbed molecular orbitals

$$
    \phi_p(x)=\sum_{q}U_{qp}(x)\phi_q(0)=\sum_{\mu}\sum_{q}U_{qp}(x)C_{\mu q}(0)f_\mu
$$

It is obvious that the perturbed coefficients $$C(x)$$ can be written as

$$
    C(x)=C(0)U(x)
$$

With defining $$F(x)\equiv C^\dagger(0)F^{AO}C(0)$$ and $$S(x)\equiv C^\dagger(0)S^{AO}C(0)$$, we have $$F(0)=E(0)$$, $$U(0)=S(0)=I$$, and

$$
    F(x)U(x)=S(x)U(x)E(x)
$$

as well as the orthonormality condition

$$
    U^\dagger(x)S(x)U(x)=I
$$

Evaluate the derivatives of the above equations with respect to $$x$$ at $$x=0$$, use the notation $$O^x\equiv\frac{\partial O}{\partial x}$$, and we have

$$
    F^x(0)+E(0)U^x(0)=S^x(0)E(0) + U^x(0)E(0) + E^x(0)
$$

$$
    U^{\dagger x}(0) + U^x(0) = - S^x(0)
$$

Ommiting the $$0$$, we have the following equations

$$
    F^x_{pq} +E_pU^x_{pq} = S^x_{pq}E_q + U^x_{pq}E_q + E^x_{p}\delta_{pq}
$$

$$
    U^{x \ast}_{qp} + U^x_{pq} = - S^x_{pq}
$$
            
for $$p=q$$

$$
    Re[U^x_{pp}] = -\frac{1}{2}S^x_{pp}
$$

for $$p\neq q$$

$$
    U^x_{pq} = \frac{F^x_{pq}-S^x_{pq}E_q}{E_q-E_p}
$$

To solve $$U^x$$, we have to know $$F^x$$ and $$S^x$$. The latter is easier and can be obtained as $$S^x(0)=C^\dagger(0) S^{AO,x} C(0)$$. For Fock operator, we have

$$\begin{gathered}
F_{pq}(x)=\sum_{\mu\nu}C_{\mu p}^{*}(0)C_{\nu q}(0)\left[h_{\mu\nu}(x)+\sum_{i\rho\sigma}C_{\rho i}^{*}(x)C_{\sigma i}(x)\langle\mu\rho||\nu\sigma\rangle(x)\right] \\
=\sum_{\mu\nu}C_{\mu p}^{*}(0)C_{\nu q}(0)\left[h_{\mu\nu}(x)+\sum_{i\rho\sigma}\sum_{ts}C_{\rho t}^{*}(0)U_{ti}^{*}(x) C_{\sigma s}(0)U_{si}(x)\langle\mu\rho||\nu\sigma\rangle(x)\right] \\
=h_{pq}(x)+\sum_{i}\sum_{ts}U_{ti}^{*}(x)U_{si}(x)\langle pt||qs\rangle(x) 
\end{gathered}$$

$$\begin{gathered}
F_{pq}^{x}=h_{pq}^{x}(0)+\sum_{i}\left[\langle pi||qi\rangle^{x}(0)+\sum_{t}U_{ti}^{x*}(0)\langle pt||qi\rangle(0)+\sum_{s}U_{si}^{x}(0)\langle pi||qs\rangle(0)\right] \\
=f_{pq}^{x}+\sum_{it}[U_{ti}^{x*}\langle pt||qi\rangle+U_{ti}^{x}\langle pi||qt\rangle] \\
=f_{pq}^{x}+\sum_{ij}\bigl[U_{ji}^{x*}\langle pj||qi\rangle+U_{ji}^{x}\langle pi||qj\rangle\bigr]+\sum_{ia}\bigl[U_{ai}^{x*}\langle pa||qi\rangle+U_{ai}^{x}\langle pi||qa\rangle\bigr] \\
=f_{pq}^{x}-\sum_{ij}S_{ij}^{x}\langle pj||qi\rangle+\sum_{ia}[U_{ai}^{x*}\langle pa||qi\rangle+U_{ai}^{x}\langle pi||qa\rangle] 
\end{gathered}$$

As a result, we have

$$U_{pq}^x=\frac{G_{pq}+\sum_{ia}[U_{ai}^{x*}\langle pa||qi\rangle+U_{ai}^x\langle pi||qa\rangle]}{E_q-E_p}$$

where

$$
G_{pq}=f_{pq}^x-S_{pq}^xE_q-\sum_{ij}S_{ij}^x\langle pj||qi\rangle
$$

We note that these equations are coupled only for $$U^x_{ai}$$ block. After solving $$U^x_{ai}$$, all the other blocks can be calculated without any iteration.
The CPHF equations for $$U^x_{ai}$$ can be reformulated as

$$\begin{bmatrix}\Delta+A&B\\B^*&\Delta+A^*\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}U^x\\U^{x*}\end{bmatrix}=-\begin{bmatrix}G^x\\G^{x*}\end{bmatrix}$$

where

$$\Delta_{bj,ai}=\bigl(E_{b}-E_{j}\bigr)\delta_{ba}\delta_{ji}$$

$$A_{bj,ai}=\langle bi||ja\rangle, B_{bj,ai}=\langle ba||ji\rangle $$

One can see that the CPHF equation has to be solved for each perturbation (or each $$x$$) independently and this would be computationally expensive. 

But as we mentioned before, the CPHF equations are not explicitly solved for first-order energy derivatives. 
This is consistent with the famous "2n+1" rule that to calculate the 2n+1 order property, one only needs to solve the n order response of the wave function.
In practice, one can show that to calculate the first-order energy derivatives, one only needs to solve the contributions with the following form

$$
\sum_{ia}\left(U_{ai}^{x}I_{ai}^\ast+U_{ai}^{x\ast}I_{ai}\right)
$$

It can be reformulated as

$$\left[\begin{array}{cc}I^*&I\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}U^x\\U^{x*}\end{array}\right]=-\left[\begin{array}{cc}I^*&I\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}\Delta+A&B\\B^*&\Delta+A^*\end{array}\right]^{-1}\left[\begin{array}{c}G^x\\G^{x*}\end{array}\right]$$

If we can solve the following equation to obtain $$D$$ intermediates

$$\left[\begin{array}{cc}D^* & D\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}\Delta+A&B\\B^*&\Delta+A^*\end{array}\right]=-\left[\begin{array}{cc}I^* & I\end{array}\right]$$

the original contributions can be written as

$$
\sum_{ia}\left(U_{ai}^{x}I_{ai}^\ast+U_{ai}^{x\ast}I_{ai}\right) = 
\sum_{ia}\left(G_{ai}^{x}D_{ai}^\ast+G_{ai}^{x\ast}D_{ai}\right)
$$

This is so-called "Z-vector" method in quantum chemistry. We emphasize that the Z-vector equations to solve $$D$$ intermediates are perturbation-independent. It only needs to be solved once and can be used to calculate any first-order energy derivatives.
