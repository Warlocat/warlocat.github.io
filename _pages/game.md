I made a few video games with [RPG Maker](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/) and other game engines. 
One of there games is more complete but still in very early stage and may not be smooth when playing.
I put it here just for fun after realizing that video games made by RPG Maker are actually html- and js-based so that they can be played online.

[北中一梦](../bzym/index.html) (chinese version only) This is a puzzle game with a little bit of horror based on my high school 山东省北镇中学. 
Although I do like my classmates and (most of) my teachers at my high school,
I have to admit that this game mostly reflects my negative opinions towards the school and the educational system behind it.
