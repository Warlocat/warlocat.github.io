I am Chaoqun Zhang 张超群, currently a post-doc working with [Professor Tianyu Zhu](https://www.tianyuzhu.org/) at Department of Chemistry, Yale University.
I got my Ph.D. degree with [Professor Lan Cheng](https://chemistry.jhu.edu/directory/lan-cheng/) at Johns Hopkins University and my Bachelor degree at Zhejiang University.

My research focused on the electronic structure theories, with expertise in coupled-cluster methods and relativistic quantum chemistry. I develop electronic structure methods and codes, as well as apply them to realistic systems.
I am particularly interested in molecules and materials where spin-orbit coupling plays significant roles, including heavy-element-contain systems, spin defects, molecular spin qubits, and so on.
Besides, I work on the treatment of vibronic/electron-phonon coupling, from laser-coolable molecules to strongly-correlated materials.
