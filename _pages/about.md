I am Chaoqun Zhang 张超群, currently a post-doc working with [Professor Tianyu Zhu](https://www.tianyuzhu.org/) at Department of Chemistry, Yale University.
I got my Ph.D. degree with [Professor Lan Cheng](https://chemistry.jhu.edu/directory/lan-cheng/) at Johns Hopkins University and my Bachelor degree at Zhejiang University.

I work on electronic structure theories, with expertise in relativistic quantum chemistry. I am interested in molecules and materials where spin-orbit coupling plays significant roles, including heavy-element-contain systems, spin defects, molecular spin qubits, and so on.
